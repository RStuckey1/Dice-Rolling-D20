Randomness: Uses a random number generator to enforce fairness for each throw.

Based on the info selected in the drop down menus, the result of the rolls will appear below inside of the same container. The values will stay visible for the player to refer to until the Reset Button is used for new rolls. 

## Table

The table functions as a visual representaion of the input values dictated by the user.
